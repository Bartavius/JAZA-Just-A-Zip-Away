# What this is
JAZA is a web application that connects companies to roadtrip enthusiasts looking to earn cash on the side. Most likely, every company of scale (especially those involved in the vehicle rental business) will eventually need their company vehicles to be relocated into more populated, and dense locations. As such, they end up paying a large sum of cash for independent contractors and employees to relocate their vehicles (~40-60+usd an hour rate). This is where JAZA comes in: we offer companies the opportunity to create vehicle relocation bounties at a lower rate to allow roadtrip enthusiasts to drive their vehicles. The general pay rate would typically be just enough to cover housing and/or food, in exchange for a free vehicle that can be shared between friends. By doing this, the companies will be able to relocate their vehicles at a lower cost, and roadtrip enthusiasts will also not have to worry about costs and the (boring) road trip back home.

# Personal Roles
Personally, this project was really fun to work on as its the first time that our friend group was able to work on a project together. Bart was the only person who really had any sort of experience in web development, so Jason and Patrick had to learn web development and building RESTful API all in a night. For Bart, he's never really considered himself a frontend engineer, so he challenged himself to take on a prominent, foreign position in UI/UX design and frontend development without using pre-built components/libraries outside of just Bootstrap css. For all of us, this was a massive learning experience and a lot of fun concocting an amalgamation of functional chaos.

# Backend

Before use make sure that all the packages are installed, the packages are listed in [requirements.txt](Backend/requirements.txt)
Then navigate to the Backend/src directory and run:

```
(py|python|python3) manage.py runserver
```

Now the backend should be running on localhost:8000

<sub><sup>Fine print: The polls directory in the backend was used for testing only and has has no functionality within the application.</sup></sub>
